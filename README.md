# Login app February 2025

This application provides a login system that allows external users to log into the system do perform a list of actions. There're a few different user roles, including admin, helper, visitor. Users would need to register their login account and then using their login credentials to log into the system.

There are three user roles in this system:
1. Admin
2. Helper 
3. Vistor 

One login form for all types of users including visitors, helpers, and
admins, they would need to log in using the same form, without having to
specify their role. Password hashes would be stored, not actual passwords.
